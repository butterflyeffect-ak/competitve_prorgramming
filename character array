#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){


    //character array in c,c++
    int n=5;
    //plus one is creation on size  of the array for the termination of the string
    char str[n+1];
    //if intialise this with string 
    char str[n+1]="hello";
    //now null is automatically inserted at the end of the arrray
    //same goes for taking input
    cin>>str;
    //then it enter button auotmatically turn into null charater '\0'
    //only condition it has to be size +1 array
    
    //for getting to know it len of the string without the null character then we have to use the 
    strlen(str) funtion to get knoow the exact length of the string
    return 0;
}

why do we need to use string object which is class not any primitive data type;
because it not static which mean it is not of fixed  size and we  can use any length of the string at the run time
string s;
ci>>s;
as much u give only thing once the compiler understand the enter or backspace enter the string is ended so remember that;
