here talk about bits operator and some great tricks that can be used to solve problem
bits operator are generally work fast because they take less amount of time as compare to (* / %)
(1-1 )are called set her mean it is set 


& operator (1-1) res(1)
| operator (1-1,1-0 ,0-1)  res(1)
^ operator (1-1 ,0-0)  res(0)
left shift a<<n=a*2^n (add zero)
right shift a>>n=a/2^n (remove last bit)

computer can not subtract that is why they use two compliment 
for finding even or odd it is useful number in the bits from right to left are 2^1,2^2,2^3...........
n&1=1(odd )else (even)

q. how to check min number of bit change is required to change a-->b 
this we can do very easily a^b =result number of set which is the min number to bit u need to change to make a-->b

q. how to check set bit ?
count=0
while(n>0){
    count+=(n&1);
    n=(n>>1)(right shift)
}

q. how to remove last set bit of an number(n)
ans=n&(n-1)

q.how to swap number
a=5
b=7 
a=a^a^b;
b=b^b^a;

q. how to extract i bit?
n&(1<<i)(i is the bit u want to extract from right side 0,1,2,3)

q. how to change the i bit?
n|(1<<i)
